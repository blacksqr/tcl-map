    <h2>Data Models</h2>
  </center>
  <p>A 
  <em>data model</em> is a mental model of the nature of some data. It
  answers such questions as the following:</p>
  <h3>What values can the data take?</h3>Are they all numeric? Are they
  all integers? Is the set of possible values finite? What are the
  minimum and maximum possible values? Are &#8734; and 
  <em>NaN</em> possible values? Do some values have special meanings,
  such as indicating undefined or missing data?
  <h3>What is the measurement level?</h3>
  <p>Data is often classified as follows according to 
  <i>measurement level</i>:</p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Name of Level</th>
      <th align="center">Description</th>
      <th align="center">Valid Operations</th>
      <th align="center">Appropriate Measure of Central&#160;Tendency</th>
      <th align="center">Examples</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nominal</td>
      <td>Values denote categories which have no order</td>
      <td>= &#8800;</td>
      <td>mode</td>
      <td>color, postal code (e.g. zip), chemical species (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ordinal</td>
      <td>Values ordered. Differences meaningless</td>
      <td>= &#8800; &lt; &#8804; &gt; &#8805;</td>
      <td>median</td>
      <td>Richter earthquake scale, dates in form YYYYMMDD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>interval</td>
      <td>Differences valid. Quotients meaningless</td>
      <td>= &#8800; &lt; &#8804; &gt; &#8805; + &#8722;</td>
      <td>arithmetic mean</td>
      <td>temperature in &deg;C</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ratio</td>
      <td>Quotients valid</td>
      <td>= &#8800; &lt; &#8804; &gt; &#8805; + &#8722; × ÷</td>
      <td>geometric mean</td>
      <td>temperature in &deg;K</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h3>How accurate are the values?</h3>
  <p>A 
  <em>measurement error</em> is the difference between the 
  <em>true value</em> and the 
  <em>measured value</em>. Measured values can differ from true values
  due to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>finite precision of instrument</li>
    <li>systematic errors (e.g. inadequately calibrated
    instrument)</li>
    <li>random errors (due to finite size of sample)</li>
    <li>sampling errors (due to non-randomness of sample)</li>
    <li>blunders (e.g. a human misreading an instrument)</li>
  </ul>It is desirable to include error estimates with data.
  <h3>Are the data located in some space?</h3>
  <p>A 
  <em>time series</em> consists of values located along the time
  dimension. 
  <em>Geographic</em> data is located along spatial dimensions such as
  latitude, longitude and altitude and may also have a time dimension.
  Note that longitude is 
  <em>cyclic</em>.</p>
  <p>The dimensions of the space can have a measurement level of 
  <em>nominal</em>. For example, an accounting spreadsheet might have
  columns corresponding to 
  <em>charge codes</em> and rows corresponding to 
  <em>company divisions</em>.</p>
  <p>Data located in a continuous space can be either 
  <em>gridded</em> or 
  <em>scattered</em>. Both types are discussed in 
  <a href="grid.html">NAP Grids</a>.</p>
