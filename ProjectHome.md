This GSoC 2009 project attempts to extend Tcl support for GIS applications in general. In particular it introduces Tcl bindings to GDAL/OGR libraries, that allow access to many different raster and vector geospatial data formats. Furthermore, a new Tcl extension will allow for reading and redenring of these formats in a Tk canvas (Tkpath) widget.

The exact supported GIS file formats can be found at:
